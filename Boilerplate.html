        About Me
    </h2>
       <p>
        My name is Tajee Goode, and I am a student at the Code The Dream Academy. I am currently learning HTML and CSS, and I am nervous to build my first web page. My interests include coding, music, and gaming. I hope to deepen my knowledge in programming and hopefully create confidence in becoming a video game programmer.
